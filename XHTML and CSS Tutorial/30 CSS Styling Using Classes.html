/*Control Styles Using a class
Previously you used to use elements to affect all 100% of a chosen tags.
You also used the <span> tag to affect the contents of a tag partially.

Using a class, allows to affect a tag partially. I works like span on a greater
scale and gives you more control.

Start with a period to call a class and name it something related to its properties.*/
