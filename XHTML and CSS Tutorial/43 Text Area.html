Tags vs. elements vs. attributes

HTML elements
An element is a set of opening and closing tags in use.

An element in HTML represents some kind of structure or semantics and generally
consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. The following is a paragraph
element:

<p>This is the content of the paragraph element.</p>

HTML tags

Tags are used to mark up the start and end of an HTML element.
<p></p>

HTML attributes
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

An attribute defines a property for an element, consists of an attribute/value
pair, and appears within the element’s start tag. An element’s start tag may
contain any number of space separated attribute/value pairs.

The most popular misuse of the term “tag” is referring to alt attributes as
“alt tags”. There is no such thing in HTML. Alt is an attribute, not a tag.

<img src="foobar.gif" alt="A foo can be balanced on a bar by placing its fubar
 on the bar's foobar.">-->

      </style>

			<form>
        Tell me about yourself:
        <br/>
        <!--This creates a text box to enter text.-->
						<textarea name="bio" rows="8" cols="80">Type something here.</textarea>

						<br/><br/>


        <!--Input tag is for input

        attribute input  type is text

        atribute name is username value

        atribute size is input bar size

        maxlength is limit users to enters the value you defined
        (5 characters in this case).

        Attribute value allows your to fill the text box with instructions for
        the user.
