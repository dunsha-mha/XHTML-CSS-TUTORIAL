<!--
To use CSS always use <style></style> tags with css/stext type inside the <head></head> tags. 
Ex: <style type ="text/css"></style> inside the <head></head> tags.

Inside the style tags, you must add the element you would like to change. In this case,
the paragraph element (p) w/ a space  + curly brackets (p {}) 
+ property "color" p {color:} + colon p {color:} + value "blue"
 p {color:blue} + closed by a semi colon p {color:blue;}.
 
 In the example, you will change all the paragraph text to blue.
 
 Example:
 <style type="text/css">	
	p {color:blue;}
</style>

To add another rule to an element:

Add another property inside the curly brackets and close it with a semi colon:

<style type="text/css">	
	p {color:blue;
	font-family:arial
	}
</style

THERE ARE AT LEAST HUNDREDS OF CSS PROPERTIES, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO MEMORIZE THEM ALL.
-->

<style type="text/css">	
	p {color:blue;
	font-family:arial;
	}
</style>
	</head>

	<body>

		This is normal text.
		<p>This is a paragraph text with the p element changed to blue using CSS.</p>

	</body>
